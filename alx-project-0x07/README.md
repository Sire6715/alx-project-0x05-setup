## ✅ Best Practices Implemented

### 🔹 Component Organization
- Logical separation of layout and functional components  
- Reusable components (`ImageCard`)  
- Proper component typing with TypeScript

### 🔹 State Management
- Proper use of React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)  
- Custom hook for API calls (`useFetchData`)  
- Type-safe state definitions

### 🔹 API Handling
- Server-side API route for secure API key usage  
- Proper error handling  
- Loading states

### 🔹 Security
- API keys stored in environment variables  
- Server-side API calls to protect keys  
- Input sanitization (with room for improvements)

### 🔹 UI/UX
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS  
- Loading indicators  
- Image gallery with preview functionality  
- Clean, intuitive interface

### 🔹 Type Safety
- TypeScript interfaces for all components and props  
- Type-safe API responses  
- Generic typing in custom hooks
